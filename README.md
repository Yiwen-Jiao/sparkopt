This project provides flexible abstractions for building machine learning
models/algorithms using Apache Spark ML. Specifically, the following are
easily customizable:

* prediction function
* loss function
* optimization routine

Being able to easily plug in the custom components above allows users to
improve the scale of their algorithms, express a richer set of algorithms
than what is currently available in Spark ML, and even improve upon
existing Spark ML algorithms.
